## 💡 Project Background

The idea for this project comes from Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript learning course, with added features and personal improvements such as:

✅ Using Parcel for bundling
✅ Applying MVC architecture
✅ Implementing pagination
✅ Combining functional and class-based approaches
✅ Adding responsive design with Bootstrap

This project represents my first use of NPM, Node Modules, and several modern JavaScript concepts.
